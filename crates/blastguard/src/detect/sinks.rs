/// needs exactly that distinction: a downstream interpreter is only "fed" an
/// upstream fetch's output when the two are joined by an actual `|`. `curl url
/// && bash script.sh` runs `bash` as a fresh, disconnected command (it never
/// sees `curl`'s stdout) and must stay Allow; only a real pipe wires the two

///     argument and is therefore INDEPENDENT of what the outer command is or

///     `curl … | sh` as a live subprocess to build the string `cat` will

///     body's own pipeline there.
